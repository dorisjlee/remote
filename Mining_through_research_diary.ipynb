      "Camillia Matuk        School of Education at Berkeley    Designing curriculum-integrated technologies that scaffold and assess science inquiry learning    How can technology help people manage the complexity of inquiry-based learning and instruction? Students building explanations must distinguish among various often conflicting ideas. Teachers planning instruction and guidance must monitor their diverse students’ understanding. Designers creating curriculum require finer-grained information on students’ learning than can be found in typical pre and post tests. This presentation describes tools integrated into the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) to both scaffold and capture students’ developing understanding.    Camillia Matuk is a postdoc in the Technology Enhanced Learning in Science Center, directed by Marcia Linn at the University of California, Berkeley. She is also a part-time lecturer in the Graduate School of Education, where she teaches cognition and technology courses for graduate students (SESAME, EMST) and for preservice teachers in mathematics and science (MACSME), and in multicultural urban secondary English (MUSE). As a postdoc, Camillia helps manage two multi-year NSF-funded projects (VISUAL and CLASS) focused on developing and researching technology-enhanced curricula and tools for middle and high school science inquiry. She also co-leads annual professional development activities around integrating technology into inquiry-based science instruction, and with the goal of building a collaborative design community among teachers, researchers, and developers.\r\n",
